 ✅ _Sophomore CS-Math double major at UMass Amherst_\
 ✅ _Passionate about both the theory behind and the real world implementation of Machine Learning, open to learning in all kinds of areas!_

I really enjoy the possibility of finding solutions to real-world problems, and aim to work in using AI for public good by ensuring safety, privacy, and ethics while making everyone's life easier. Currently, I am working on projects to extend my knowledge about AI and improve my problem-solving skills. As a Break Through Tech Fellow, I had the opportunity to work in a group and delve into interpretable AI, which greatly aligned with my interests! I would love to gain further experience by an internship and dive deeper into Machine Learning used in the industry.

## <Break Through Tech Project>(https://github.com/Catalan-AI-Studio/energy-demand-prediction): Interpretable Insights from Tree Based Models using LLMs with Catalan.ai
✨What we did: Developed a tree based model that predicts the electricity demand in Texas, and utilized LLMs to explain the decisions made by the model to enhance transparency and interpretability.\
